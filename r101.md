Ts method

// std = namespace of standard, basically everything in C++
// << is how you  display something to console. printf, print, etc
// cout = character output

# Ok we gettin into objects

projects - collections of instructions that manipulate data for a desired result

mk so we have to initialize and use objects so that we dont try to access memory directly...
an object being a region of storage/memory that can hold a value
variables vs objects - OOOOOH WHAT variables are named objects... Yo...

int x;

default initialization - garbage value - int x;
copy initialization - less efficient - int x = 5;
direct initialization - used when values are explicitly cast to other types, like static_cast, now superseded by direct-list-initialization - int x ( 5 );
**list initialization - consistent and you can easily tell we're naming an obj. - int x { 5 };
value/zero initialization - initializes to zero - int x {};

int e { 9 }, f { 10 };     // direct-list-initialization
